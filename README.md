# 🐀 Rats.lgbt Email Server with Linux 🏳️‍🌈
Setting up a private Email Server with Linux

# Why Self-Host?
I wanted to challenge myself to create and manage my own email server to handle my tld, rats.lgbt. This domain has been sitting around for years untouched and I feel like it would be fun to have an email at that domain. I registered the domain with NameCheap, which offers an email service for domains, but I'd prefer to set up my own just as a fun little linux project 👽

#Challenges and Considerations
Because virtually every resource I've found advise against self-hosting an email server, the theme of this project will be doing things the hard way. I will seek to take as few shortcuts as possible to gain as much knowledge about this subject as I can. From what I've read, the greatest challenge for a self-hosted email server is long-term support, so I may end up just scrapping the server at some point and moving over to a paid email service for my @rats.lgbt email domain.
I will consider this project a success if I am able to send and receive email from an @rats.lgbt email address to my personal gmail account.

#1. Do I actually know anything about Linux?
