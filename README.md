# 🐀 Rats.lgbt Email Server with Ubuntu 🏳️‍🌈
Setting up an Email Server with Ubuntu

# Why Self-Host?
I wanted to challenge myself to create and manage my own email server to handle my tld, rats.lgbt. This domain has been sitting around for years untouched and I feel like it would be fun to have an email at that domain. I registered the domain with NameCheap, which offers an email service for domains, but I'd prefer to set up my own just as a fun little linux project 👽
